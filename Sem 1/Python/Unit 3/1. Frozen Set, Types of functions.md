## Frozen Set
A frozen set is an **array of values** that shares all the characteristics of set, the only difference being that it is **immutable** *(Not changeable)*

#### What is recursion?
Calling a function within it self **given that base condition is provided**
<font size="2"> i.e calling a function within itself normally would cause the code to get stuck in an infinite loop, so a base condition means code that tells a function when to stop looping</font>
<details>
<summary><b>Example Usage</b></summary> 

Code to find factorial:
```py
def factorial(number):
    if number == 1: # this is base condition
        return 1 # because factorial of 1 is 1
    else:
        return number * factorial(number - 1) # here we recursively call factorial()
   
factorial_of_a_number=factorial(5) # here the function will return factorial of 5
print(factorial_of_a_number) 
```
<font size="3"> here the factorial function recursively calls itself because the factorial of a natural number greater than 1 is the product of the number and the factorial of its precession, and the base condition here is 1, because the factorial of 1 is 1 (the factorial of 1 is **not** 1 × 0)</font>

Factorial of a number is the product of that number and all the natural numbers less than it, for example: factorial of 5 = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120<br>
here is the list of return values and resolved values for every time the function recurses:
| Recursion Number | Return value of function | Resolved value    |
|------------------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| 1                | 5 * factorial(4)         | 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 |
| 2                | 4 * factorial(3)         | 4 × 3 × 2 × 1     |
| 3                | 3 * factorial(2)         | 3 × 2 × 1         |
| 4                | 2 * factorial(1)         | 2 × 1             |
| 5                | 1                        | 1                 |

#### What are callbacks in Python?

<font size="2">Callbacks in Python refer to **functions that can be passed as arguments to other functions**. They are used to customize or extend the behavior of the calling function.</font>

<details>
<summary><b>Example usage</b></summary>

```py
def perform_operation(x, y, callback):
    result = x + y
    callback(result)

def print_result(value):
    print("Result:", value)

perform_operation(3, 4, print_result)
```
